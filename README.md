# 🛰 About
cazz - This is an internal project I was working on about a year ago. The features are incomplete because I spent most of my time reversing interfaces so check out the SDK.

## ☂️ Features
- Decent ImGui menu with FreeType font rendering
- Complete .json config system
- Lots of visuals
- Added Aimbot
- Basic misc features
- Decently clean code (don't roast me)
- Decent SDK (there is some pretty cool stuff in there)
- Way more hooks than needed lmao

## 🌌 Usage
- Clone the repo
- Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio (I used 2022)
- Build in Release | x86
- Inject `kakhack.dll` into CS:GO
- Enjoy
